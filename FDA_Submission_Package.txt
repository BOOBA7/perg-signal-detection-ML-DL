## 1. DEVICE OVERVIEW

**Device Name**: PERG Signal Classifier  
**Type**: Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)  

**Indication for Use**:  
> To assist ophthalmologists in identifying alterations in pattern electroretinogram (PERG) signals, potentially indicative of early-stage retinal or optic nerve dysfunction (e.g., glaucoma, inherited dystrophies, optic neuropathies).

**Device Description**:  
A software-based decision-support tool for binary classification of electrophysiological PERG signals, developed using:
- Traditional machine learning models trained on FFT-derived features and basic clinical metadata.
- A deep neural network trained on concatenated frequency-domain features and demographic variables.

**Output**:  
- Binary prediction: `"Normal PERG"` or `"Altered PERG"`  
- Associated probability score with user-adjustable threshold

## 2. INTENDED USE

- **Target Population**: Adults aged 18‚Äì90 undergoing PERG testing for functional assessment  
- **Intended Use Setting**: Ophthalmology clinics and vision science laboratories  
- **End Users**: Ophthalmologists, neuro-ophthalmologists, and trained technicians  
- **Clinical Role**: Decision support only; not intended for autonomous diagnosis  
- **Device Status**: Prototype under research; not FDA-cleared

## 3. DATA & LABELING

**Dataset**: PERG-IOBA Dataset (publicly available via PhysioNet)  
**Cohort Summary**:
- 304 individual patients, collected between 2003 and 2022 at IOBA (Spain)  
- Age: 4 to 86 years (mean ¬± SD: 37.1 ¬± 18.3)  
- Sex: 155 female participants  
- Some participants underwent multiple visits  
- 100 participants were labeled clinically ‚Äúnormal‚Äù  

**Final Modeling Dataset**:
- 242 cleaned and complete records with valid RE_1 and LE_1 signals and metadata  
- **Signals**: RE_1 and LE_1 (300 Hz sampling rate)  
- **Metadata**: Age, sex, diagnosis  
- **Ground Truth Labels**:  
  - `1`: Pathological PERG (e.g., RP, Stargardt, optic neuropathy)  
  - `0`: Normal PERG  
- Labels derived from expert-reviewed metadata (`metadata_clinical.csv`)

## 4. MODELS EVALUATED

**Machine Learning Models**:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest (best balance of metrics)  
- XGBoost  

**Deep Learning Model**:
- Fully connected neural network (Keras/TensorFlow)  
- Inputs: RE_1 + LE_1 FFT features + age + sex  
- Architecture: Dense layers with BatchNorm and Dropout  
- Optimizer: Adam ‚Äì Loss: Binary Crossentropy  
- Thresholds optimized for F1-score or sensitivity (‚â• 0.90)

## 5. PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

| Model               | Threshold | Sensitivity | Specificity | F1-Score | Balanced Accuracy | AUC-ROC |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Random Forest**   | 0.440     | 0.864       | **0.545**   | 0.745    | **0.705**         | **0.768** |
| Deep Learning (FCN) | 0.400     | **1.000**   | 0.045       | 0.737    | 0.522             | 0.740   |
| XGBoost             | 0.061     | **1.000**   | 0.227       | 0.721    | 0.614             | 0.680   |
| Logistic Regression | 0.268     | 0.909       | 0.273       | 0.690    | 0.591             | 0.727   |
| Decision Tree       | 0.500     | 0.364       | 0.545       | 0.400    | 0.455             | 0.455   |

**Interpretation**:  
- **Random Forest** provides the best overall performance across AUC and balanced accuracy.  
- **Deep Learning model** reaches perfect sensitivity (1.00), but at the cost of very low specificity (0.045).  
- **XGBoost** similarly achieves full sensitivity but poor specificity.  
- **Logistic Regression** offers interpretability and moderate performance.  
- **Decision Tree** performs poorly and is not recommended.

## 8. RISK ANALYSIS (ISO 14971-Inspired)

| ‚ö†Ô∏è False Positives (unnecessary concern)| Flag for clinician review; specificity tracking         |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset Bias                     | Stratified splits; class balance maintained                |
| ‚ùå Overfitting Risk (small N)        | Dropout, regularization, and early stopping applied         |
