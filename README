# üß† PERG Signal Detection via Machine Learning

This project explores the application of traditional machine learning models to classify pattern electroretinogram (PERG) signals as either healthy or pathological.

## Key Highlights

- Preprocessing of raw PERG signals from the PERG-IOBA dataset
- Feature engineering: extraction of statistical, clinical, and frequency-domain features from RE_1 and LE_1 signals
- Binary classification: distinguishing healthy vs. altered PERG signals
- Evaluation:
  - On a **real-world-prevalence-based test set** (~2%)
  - On a **balanced test set** (50/50)
  - Using **cross-validation**
- Models used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
